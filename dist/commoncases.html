          <p>Losing distance on your drive? Not able to make that turn for a big back swing or having back pain when you do? Dr. Meyer comments: </p>
          <p>Many older golfers have a little arthritis in the lower spine. The small spaces through which the nerves exit are encroached upon by the "spurs". As the right-handed golfer swings back, he often doesn't just rotate his torso but also bends slightly to the right over the right hip. This causes the bony elements on the right to get closer to eachother and often the nerve is pinched. The low back as well as the buttock and hipbecome painful because they are innervated by that nerve.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, this is all treatable! One has to first relearn how to rotate the torsowithout bending right or with excessive sway, while also putting one's weight into thatback leg and hip instead. Many have lost these proper mechanics but with practice onecan regain that neuromotor control. The buttock (ideally with the strongest muscles inthe body) is meant to takes its appropriate load. When the low back muscles take the brunt, they stay tight rather than flexible and they limit that all important rotation for agood back swing.</p>
          <p>If good training is not enough, one can have prolotherapy. Prolotherapy canstrengthen the ligaments that support those spinal elements. Once the ligaments arestronger they maintain the space so the nerve can exit unimpinged. Also when the ligaments do their job, the muscles can again stay more relaxed. When the ligaments between the spine and the big hip bone (iliolumbar) are strong, they promote efficienttransfer of weight from the spine to the hip.</p>
          <p>Prolotherapy is essentially the exact opposite of a steroid injection. It is done in the office without any time away from the golf course. Make an appointment for a fullevaluation to determine what adjustments you need in your swing and whether or notyou are a candidate for prolotherapy. Regain those 20-40 yards you have lost! </p>

          <h3 class="media-heading">Runners</h3>
          <p>As a runner I know you never want to have to take time off.  I also know that you are fairly independent-minded and want to treat yourself.  This makes for an athlete who educates him or herself and is disciplined enough to follow through with a believable regimen, even if it hurts.  Unfortunately, no pain no gain is often not the best approach.</p>
          <p>There are so many "experts" out there, or people who swear by something that worked for them and assume you would benefit too.  One problem is they don't know you or your body.   In addition, you are not able to evaluate yourself fully; your gait pattern, biomechanics, etc.  Finally, the area of pain is often just the tip of the iceberg; the extra load to that region is due to a weakness elsewhere. </p>
          <p>Instead of cutting back, taking Ibuprofen or even worse getting a shot of cortisone, only to resume with the same bad mechanics and now more compromised because of your time off, find out what is really going on with your body.  Instead of seeing a surgeon or doing generic exercises for your problem, get an individualized program that is right for you.  It must take into account your complete history of injuries, your age, gender, muscle strength, neuromotor patterns, your unique anatomy, flexibility, joint health, coordination.  We are each so unique that what I would consider abnormal for one person, may be functioning maximally for another. The human body is truly an amazing machine, and no two are alike, so why apply a one size fits all approach.  Of course, once a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan is put into affect at the appropriate pace, reassessment is paramount.  If something can't be completely fixed, the best way to compensate can be determined and realistic goals set.</p>
          <p>For example, I am a 53 year old woman. Because of congenital and developmental reasons, I have right-sided femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, forefoot varus,  and L5/S1 spondylolisthesis. This means that when I was running 70 miles per week and competing in college in cross-country, indoor and outdoor track, I developed horrific patellar pain for many years. I was also prone to plantar fasciitis and hip strains. Now  I have some knee DJD and SI instability but because I am an MD specializing in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation I am able to manage my occasional hip, ITBand, achilles, plantar and other pains. I also rehabbed myself after rupturing my soleus when I stupidly wore sprinting spikes to run a 2:40 800 2 years ago. The good news is I can still out run most of the high school girls I coach (a high school soccer team). But, I also couldn't physically perform without having prolotherapy. </p>
          <p>Prolotherapy is the injecting of a natural hypertonic solution, i.e. dextrose  into a specific site in order to illicit an inflammatory response.  The body reacts by laying down fresh tissue to the area. One can treat ligaments that are overstretched and weakened, and damaged tendons where they attach to the bone. A damaged joint (i.e. degeneration of the meniscus or bone spurring) can become pain free.  Wherever your pain; shoulder to the hand, hip to the foot, neck to the low back,  prolotherapy in conjunction with other training has provided me and most all my patients with the improvement they needed to keep active without big breaks in their training.</p>
          <p>Nobody likes getting injured. But, at least for me I always have known that I will learn  from my injury and together with my running career and musculoskeletal training and practice for over 20 years, I am able to help others.</p>

          <h3 class="media-heading">The Knee Obsession</h3>
          <p>Have you ever wondered why so many people complain of painful knees?   Were they not meant to withstand the stresses of today’s everyday activities?  And why is this, even with all the knee exercises?</p>
          <p>Medications, knee exercises, and knee arthroscopy seem to be the mainstay.  Traditional arthroscopic debridement is really only indicated for those “whose knees catch, lock, or give way” i.e. “due to either a loose piece of meniscus or cartilage”.  Studies have concluded that there is no difference between patients who received a “sham” versus an arthroscopic procedure for their painful knee.</p>
          <p>There is an alternative!   It is common sense that if one’s center of gravity is shifted, more or less weight is placed on the knees.  If one’s other musculature is not engaged properly, especially in the case of the abs/core or the gluts/hips to share the load, no matter how strong the knee muscles are they cannot eliminate the stress to the joint.  Not only do studies validate these findings but studies in fact showed that the imbalance of quad strength actually was causing the increase in back pain in many professional basketball players. </p>
          <p>Improper exercise like incorrectly performed squats, step ups, lunges;  walking and running without appropriate biomechanics and the proximal strength is a formula for knee pain and the cause of today’s epidemic.  ACL tears could be so reduced especially in the female population by appropriate training.   The solution is not medications, knee exercises, or arthroscopy.  Learn how to train your body correctly, get to the real cause of your knee troubles.  Avoid a trip to the OR and continue an active lifestyle. </p>

          <h3 class="media-heading">The Shoulder Dilemma</h3>
          <p>Many people today have pain in their shoulder as a result of impingement of the rotator cuff.  As a result they receive treatment directed at the 4 rotator cuff muscles, tendons, and their insertion site (the bursa) on the humerus bone.  If that fails they often have a procedure to decrease the acromial spurs that have developed that are a source of irritation to the tendons.</p>
          <p>The humeral head is the ball and the scapula is the socket and the acromion is the roof of this ball and socket joint.  The ball has to be drawn up and into the socket before the arm can be moved in its full range without pain often caused by the roof (acromion) “pinching” the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons.  Secondly, the socket also has to be at the right position and if it is not, when the arm is lifted, the tendons will be impinged between the humerus and the acromion. </p>
          <p>People with shoulder pain almost always, overuse their upper trapezius and underuse their lower trapezius and serratus anterior which are muscles that rotate the scapula to position the acromion correctly. As a result the acromion lacks the tilt so as to not allow for sufficient clearance.  Very often, retraining these muscles solves the problem.  Even if there is already arthritis, restoring proper motion and stabilization restores range and takes care of the pain.  Specific exercises need to be done for this. </p>
          <p>The capsule and ligaments supporting the shoulder (labral, glenohumeral, coracoclavicular, acromioclavicular, coracoacromial, sternoclavicular) are also often stretched and no longer giving the necessary support for the ball and socket to function properly and without pain.  In this case, even if a spur is present, if these supportive structures are restored to their previous length and strength, use of the arm and shoulder can potentially become pain free.  This is how it is believed that prolotherapy is affective. </p>
          <p>Instead of surgery and cortisone injections,  exercise and/or prolotherapy is indicated.  Even if surgery or cortisone has already been done, pain relief and functional improvement can still be achieved with these alternatives. </p>
